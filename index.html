        <h1>Basedcon 🇮🇳</h1>

        <h2>event series for your biggest ideas</h2>

        <p>Every few months we host invite-only closed-door events across the country, for ambitious Indians to talk about their biggest, boldest and baddest ideas. Only your theses that you can't talk about on Twitter are allowed. Only 5 speakers presenting each time, handpicked audience of up to 25 (we call them "interruptors") and chatam house rules.</p>

        <p>We've hosted top founders, engineers, ecosystem builders, journalists, civic activists, political workers, and all kinds of people from across India in our previous events. Doesn't matter where you are and what you do, if you think you have something interesting to add, we will pay for your flights to come in. Check out highlights of our previous events below:</p>
